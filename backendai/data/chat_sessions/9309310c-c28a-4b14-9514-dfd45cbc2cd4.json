So, the key information collected is wanting personalized service info. I need to make sure that's clear in my summary.\n\nThen, the user responds with their name: \"prabhat.\" That should be included as well since it helps personalize the conversation. \n\nThe assistant then asks for their phone number or email to get more details. This shows they're gathering specific information but keep the door open for further engagement.\n\nFinally, the assistant thanks them and invites them to send more detailed info, asking how we can help today. That wraps up the next steps or outcome by inviting action on their part.\n</think>\n\nThe user greeted me with \"hey\" and asked if I knew about our services.

I thanked them and invited them to share more information, looking forward to a detailed conversation.",
